# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project state

V1 is implemented and deployed. Milestones M1–M6 plus the runtime config-command link are done; the remaining V1 gaps are product hardening (OverlayFS read-only root, physical power-cut acceptance), production networking (real SIM/APN, MQTT TLS + per-device credentials/ACL), and end-to-end integration with the server-side `route_service`, which is not yet live. See `docs/V1设计文档.md` §10 for per-milestone status and `docs/M7系统化部署设计.md` for the deployment/hardening checklist.

### Build and test

```bash
cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build   # -Wall -Wextra enforced
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

Dependencies: `nlohmann_json` (>=3.2.0), `libmosquitto` (via pkg-config), `doctest`, `python3`. On a fresh Pi run `scripts/install_deps.sh` first — it switches apt to the TUNA mirror and installs the build dependencies.

Build verification follows `docs/协作规则.md` §6: every change must build clean under `-Wall -Wextra` and keep `ctest` fully green.

### Deployment

`scripts/deploy.sh` is the only supported deployment path. It is idempotent and refuses to run outside `/home/dcdw/cns_rpi` as user `dcdw`. It builds, then installs the config helper, `cns-rpi.service`, `cellular-dialup.service` and the journald drop-in, and restarts the main service.

`config/config.json` is gitignored — it is per-device field configuration. `config/config.example.json` is the tracked template; keep the two in sync in shape, never commit real field values.

## What this repository is

RPi-side (Raspberry Pi 5, trixie/ARM64, C++23) data node for a CNS (Communication/Navigation/Surveillance) vocational-training kit. It is one of three independently-maintained parts of the product:

- **STM32F407 + FreeRTOS firmware** — separate repo (`oran9eLi/Formal_Framework`, branch `fj-lora`), maintained by the firmware architect. Not present in this working tree; treat its MAVLink message definitions and UART allocations as an external dependency, not something to modify here.
- **This repo** — the RPi node.
- **硬件部/软件部 servers** — downstream, out of scope.

Read `docs/V1设计文档.md` before making architectural changes; it is the source of truth for scope and is required to stay in sync with the code per `docs/协作规则.md` §7.

## Architecture (from design docs — read these for full detail)

**Data flow is bidirectional over a single UART link carrying MAVLink v2, common dialect only (no custom dialect XML).** In the field the link is a CH340 USB-serial adapter whose device node is not stable across reboots, so `serial.device` is set to `auto` and `uart/mavlink_port_discovery` probes candidate ports for a valid MAVLink frame; do not hardcode a `/dev/ttyUSBn` path.

- Upstream (STM32→RPi): HEARTBEAT, standard telemetry messages, `NAMED_VALUE_INT`/`TUNNEL`-encoded extension frames, `OPEN_DRONE_ID_*` identity frames → decoded → published as JSON over MQTT (RPi is a plain MQTT client; it does **not** run a local Mosquitto broker).
- Downstream (management center → MQTT → RPi → STM32): commands arrive as JSON, get dispatched, encoded as `COMMAND_LONG`, sent over UART; `COMMAND_ACK` results get reported back over MQTT. STM32 is the authority for command validation — RPi only does JSON schema sanity-checking before encoding.

**Core extensibility principle (V1设计文档.md §3)**: the MAVLink decode layer and the command-forwarding layer are each decoupled from *who consumes/produces* the data, via two internal seams:
- `state/` — decoded STM32 state, written by `protocol/` decoders, read by consumers (V1: only the MQTT publisher; V2 will add a Qt renderer and a camera/OpenCV pipeline as additional readers without touching the decoder).
- `command/` — a `command_source` interface + internal dispatcher; V1 has one source (MQTT), later sources (e.g. a local Qt UI in V2) plug in without touching the STM32-facing encode/dispatch logic.

Vendor the official `mavlink/c_library_v2` headers (`common`/`standard`/`minimal`) from the firmware repo's `Third_Party/mavlink/` verbatim — same header files on both ends, don't hand-roll frame parsing.

## Device identity (docs/设备标识符.md — do not shortcut this by reading only V1设计文档.md §6)

Multiple identifiers exist for different owners; don't conflate them:

- **`device_id` — the single business key, received passively from the F407 `OPEN_DRONE_ID_BASIC_ID.uas_id`** (`docs/设备标识符.md`). It addresses MQTT topics, the MQTT Client ID, registration, telemetry and command routing. There is no second identifier: `vendor_id`, `remote_id`, `gateway_id` and `rpi_serial` were all deleted from state and from the wire protocol — do not reintroduce them.
- **The RPi owns no business identity.** It is a MAVLink↔MQTT gateway; swapping or reimaging it must not change any `device_id`. `/proc/cpuinfo` serial is no longer read.
- `DCDW-XXX` — school-facing label, derived from firmware's `PX4LITE_UNIT_ID`. Unique only *within one school*, routinely repeats across schools. Never use as a global key.
- For the CNS box, that `uas_id` *is* the vendor unique product ID (`DCDWCNS1` + 12-char SN), structured per GB/T 41300 (MFC+PMC+SN, 20 chars, charset `0-9A-Z` minus `O`/`I`). SN is a SHA-256-truncated hash of the STM32 chip's 96-bit UID. `DCDW`/`CNS1` are product metadata parsed out of the prefix — not identity, not a firmware version.
- **SN is computed on STM32, not RPi** — because RemoteID broadcast (`STM32 → UART4 → ESP32-S3`, does not pass through RPi) needs the value locally before it ever talks to RPi. RPi receives the already-computed SN and reuses it verbatim; it must not recompute it.
- RemoteID's GB 46750 "唯一产品识别码" field reuses this same vendor ID/SN — one hash, not two.
- **The only supported endpoint is the F407 CNS box**, with `MAV_TYPE_ONBOARD_CONTROLLER` and `MAV_AUTOPILOT_INVALID`. Do not add device detection modes, ground-station UDP bridging, flight-controller identity/version requests or latency probe topics. First-time MQTT setup requires a valid F407 identity; a persistent binding can restore the control channel while the live identity is being verified. Product metadata comes from the F407 identity prefix; registration carries no inferred hardware/firmware version. Firmware-native `Px4Lite` / `px4lite_*` names are unrelated to gateway device modes and must remain intact.

## Collaboration conventions (docs/协作规则.md)

- Commit messages: `<type>: <简短中文说明>` (types: feat/fix/docs/refactor/chore/build/test), Chinese description, no long bodies.
- Source comments: Doxygen-style, Chinese, on file headers / public functions / structs — explain *why/who calls/what's off-limits*, not a translation of the code.
- Default branch `main`; feature branches `<type>/<short-desc>`.
- Architecture/protocol-scope/identity changes must be reflected in `docs/V1设计文档.md` (or the doc it points to) in the same change — do not let code and docs drift.
